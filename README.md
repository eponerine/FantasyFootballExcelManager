# FantasyFootballExcelManager
An Excel workbook designed to manage your fantasy football league

## Information
Over the years, managing a fantasy football league via ESPN, CBS, etc isn't always the easiest. While most leagues get by with the built-in features of these websites, some leagues may want customizations or additional tools.

This workbook is many years worth of those ideas implemented in the most automated way possible. Whether it be league dues, prizes, standings, multiple matchups per week, or some other foreign idea, this workbook has it all.

## Notes
For now, this is designed for a 10-team league and 2x matchups per week. This can easily be edited to accomodate different schedules, but it is not automated yet.

Despite being worked on for over 5 years, new ideas constantly come up. Please feel free to raise an issue for a new feature or bug that you want added.
